# 4. IAM User

There are basically 3 kinds of users in AWS:
1. IAM User: Those that use password and email to open a AWS account
2. The System Users: These are users that perform on behalf of the authorized individuals.
3. Federated Users: Those that are federated from your own on-premise environment without a username or any form of verification
The best practice for assigning a role to any user is by following the principle of least previlege (assign Only the required permission to perfom a task)
