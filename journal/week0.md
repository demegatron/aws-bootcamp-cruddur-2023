# Checklist 7. AWS Organizations & AWS IAM (by Ashish Rajan)

# 1. MFA 

Mutifactor Authentication means the provision of two or more verification factor by the user to gain access in the AWS account.

This is a service in the AWS cloud platform that allows you to create another account within an organization.

# 3. CloudTrail

CloudTrail records all users activity and API usage in AWS services.

# 4. IAM User

There are basically 3 kinds of users in AWS:
1. IAM User: Those that use password and email to open a AWS account
2. The System Users: These are users that perform on behalf of the authorized individuals.
3. Federated Users: Those that are federated from your own on-premise environment without a username or any form of verification
The best practice for assigning a role to any user is by following the principle of least previlege (assign Only the required permission to perfom a task)

# 5. Top 5 Security Best Practices

1. Data protection and residency in accordance to security policy.
2. Identity and Access management with the least privilege policy.
3. Governance & compliance of AWS services being used(Global vs Regional services)
4. Shared responsibity of Threat Detection
5. Incident Response plans to include cloud.
